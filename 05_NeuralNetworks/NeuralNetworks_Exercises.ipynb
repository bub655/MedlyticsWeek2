Some of its benefits are that it converges more quickly and doesn't need manual adjustment of the hyperparameter \"learning rate\".\n- **SGD**: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/SGD\n    - SGD is a **stochastic gradient descent** and momentum optimizer. SGD essentially helps gradient vectors move down loss functions towards the minimum point, leading to faster \"converging.\"\n- **RMSprop**: https://keras.io/api/optimizers/rmsprop/\n    - As you may already know, the learning rate regulates how much the model can change based on the estimated error (which occurs every time the model's weights are updated). Instead of treating the learning rate as a hyperparamter, RMSprop is an optimization technique that relies on a changing, adaptive learning rate.\n\n```\n# Example code\nl_r = .001 \ntf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=l_r)\n```","block_group":"96e9c93d1eb34ca19aa3491e1b23da42"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ldbularZ3cCW","colab_type":"text","cell_id":"ea937cc5b8ae416fb1dc9d57b2ae8196","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"## Putting Together Your Neural Network\n\nNow you will experiment with adding different layers to your neural network.
